# discord-dm-list
A tiny Python script that gets a list of everyone you have DMed on Discord from your data package.

This has already been made, however the software is proprietary. This project intends to be an open-source re-implementation of that project, **as you are ultimately trusting your Discord data with proprietary software and a random developer**, which is not something you should trust anyone with as this has very sensitive information. Over time, this program will be updated to include more features.

# How to use
Put the py file in the root of your Discord data package and run it.
